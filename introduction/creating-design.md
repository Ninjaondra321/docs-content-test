# Creating design
Design is the first thing clients judge, so it's really important. There are 3 ways of how to create your design.
## Using theme creator
Visit free <a href="/theme-creator">free theme creator</a>  I build for you and go nuts!
## Starting with a css template
You can download a template css file with most classes - empty, so that you can take it as an inspiration.
- There will be a link here - so until it's not here, go to my github and download it from there
## Completely on your own
Just do it from scratch. Becuase when there's an hard way, why do it the easy one, right?
